================

<a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~bharali/">Gautam Bharali</a>, <a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~purvigupta/">Purvi Gupta</a> and I organized a <a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~purvigupta/PSS.html">symposium</a> for postdocs and graduate students in the Math Department at IISc. 

The immediate goal of the symposium was for postdocs and graduate students to give an exposition of their research problem (or a topic close to their research) aimed at a general mathematical audience. We also wanted the symposium to start conversations, amongst postdocs and grad students, not just about math but also about how to give a research talk, what makes a research talk effective, and what doesn't, etc. 

To inculcate a sense of agency amongst postdocs and graduate students in initiating such conversations and providing feedback on talks, we decided (partly as an experiment) that faculty would not be allowed to attend the symposium talks. 

There are many online <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/math-graduates/best-practices-advice/giving-talks/">resources</a> that provide good advice on giving an effective mathematical talk and some common pitfalls to avoid while delivering math talks. At the bottom of the <a href="http://math.iisc.ac.in/~purvigupta/PSS.html">symposium</a> page, we compiled a short list of such tips from some of these online resources.
