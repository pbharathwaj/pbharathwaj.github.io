================

<hr>
<p> If you are asking for a letter of recommendation from me, please follow these guidelines: </p>

<p>
<ol>
<li> 
<ul> Please send the following materials:
<li>CV / Resume, </li>
<li> transcripts, </li> 
<li> statements (rough drafts are okay), </li>
<li> list of other <b>letter writers</b>, </li>
<li> <b>list of schools</b> you are applying to, along with their <b>deadlines</b>, </li>
<li> any other information (about our interactions and/or the program you are applying to) that you think that would be helpful. </li>
<li> if appropriate, copies of preprints.</li>
</ul>
I would prefer it if you could have a dropbox/google drive link, with all these materials, so that I don't have to plough through my email threads searching for them. 
</li>
<li> I would require <b>at least 1 month notice (ideally, two months)</b> for any letter of recommendation. </li>
<li>You must <b>waive your right to view</b> my letter of recommendation.</li>
<li> If you are asking for a letter of recommendation based on a course (let me know what class and which year you took that class) you have taken with me, I would require a grade of <b>A or A+ (9.0 or 10.0)</b>. You can let me know if you believe there is a good reason for me to waive this rule. </li>
</ol>
